# dev_test_giskard
This is a developer test for a tech interview. You can find the subject here : https://gisk.ar/jobs-software-test. It has a backend and frontend part. It is still a work in progress, I still have to integrate the backend to the frontend.

## backend demo

To test the backend, download the backend file and you can test the R2D2.py script.
### example : 
> python R2D2.py -f example1/millennium-falcon.json -e example1/empire.json
It will output the odds of reaching Endor before the death star in percentages.

## frontend demo
Open in browser the index.html file.
